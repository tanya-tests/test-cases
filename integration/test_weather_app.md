| 1. Launch the weather app on the iPhone.                                                                                   | The weather app should launch successfully without any errors or crashes.                               |
| 2. Verify that the app loads successfully and displays the current weather conditions for the user's current location.     | The app should display accurate weather information for the user's current location.                   |
| 3. Change the location to a different city and verify that the app updates the weather information accordingly.            | Changing the location should update the weather information accordingly.                                |
| 4. Toggle between different weather metrics (e.g., Celsius, Fahrenheit) and ensure that the displayed temperature units change accordingly. | The app should correctly toggle between different temperature units.                               |
| 5. Verify that the app provides accurate and up-to-date weather forecasts for the next 3, 5, and 7 days.                    | The weather forecasts displayed by the app should be accurate and updated.                             |
| 6. Tap on the current temperature displayed on the app and verify that it expands to show additional details such as humidity, wind speed, and sunrise/sunset times. | Tapping on the current temperature should expand and show additional details accurately.           |
| 7. Verify that the app provides a search functionality to look up the weather for specific cities.                          | The search functionality should successfully retrieve and display weather information for specific cities. |
| 8. Enter a city name in the search bar and verify that the app displays the weather information for the entered city accurately. | The app should provide detailed weather information for selected days in the forecast.                |
| 9. Tap on a specific day in the forecast and verify that the app shows detailed weather information for that particular day.  | The app should allow adding locations as favorites and display accurate weather information for the added favorites. |
| 10. Check if the app provides the option to add locations as favorites and verify that the added favorites are accessible and display accurate weather information. | Enabling and disabling weather notifications should work as expected.                          |
| 11. Verify that the app provides an option to enable/disable weather notifications and test the functionality by enabling notifications for a specific location. | The app should send timely and accurate weather notifications based on the configured settings. |
| 12. Verify that the app sends timely and accurate weather notifications based on the configured settings.                   | The app should display weather data from reliable sources and integrate with external services seamlessly. |
| 13. Ensure that the app integrates with external services like weather APIs and displays data from reliable sources.         | The app should handle network connectivity issues gracefully and provide appropriate fallback data or error messages. |
| 14. Verify that the app handles network connectivity issues gracefully and provides appropriate error messages or fallback data when offline. | The app should remain responsive and stable during continuous interaction.                       |
| 15. Test the app's performance by continuously interacting with different features and verifying that it remains responsive and stable. | -                                                                                             |
